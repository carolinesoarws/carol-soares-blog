It\u2019s a lot to handle, and today, I want to talk about what\u2019s usually left unsaid.\\n\\n## The Hidden Depression\\nI started my career at 20. Looking back, I was really young when I first entered the corporate world and realized how tough it can be. I struggled a lot to find my place as a developer\u2014and being a woman added a whole other layer of challenge (but that\u2019s a topic for another post). I pushed myself to learn what I could, to be better every single day, until I hit burnout at 23.\\n\\nDuring that period, I didn\u2019t know how to take care of myself. I kept comparing my journey and skills to others, constantly feeling like I wasn\u2019t good enough. I would cry every day in the bathroom at work if I made a mistake or didn\u2019t meet expectations. The worst part? The pressure was all coming from inside\u2014I just didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.\\n\\nIt got even worse. I watched people around me get promoted or recognized, while I felt invisible. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? Why am I not like them?\u201d I asked myself over and over. I kept chasing improvement, but no matter how much I tried, I felt like I\u2019d never be that standout developer\u2014the one who\u2019s different, better, the reference for others. Three years into my career, that\u2019s how I felt.\\n\\nHonestly, sometimes I still do. Every time I open LinkedIn, attend a conference, or talk to other developers, I question if I\u2019m enough. When the industry starts hyping a new technology, I panic: \u201cHow am I supposed to learn everything, fast? How will I meet expectations? Where do I even start?\u201d\\n\\nIf I don\u2019t have experience with a certain technology\u2014one I never even had the chance to work with\u2014I feel like I\u2019m failing at \u201cbeing that amazing, senior, all-knowing developer who\u2019s a role model no matter the company.\u201d\\n\\nEven after years of therapy, these feelings still pop up. It\u2019s tough to deal with them every single day. That\u2019s the hidden depression for me. Everyone tries to look perfect (and maybe they are), while I feel like I\u2019ll never measure up. Tech is an amazing, exciting world, but it can also be lonely, overwhelming, and sometimes, deeply painful.\\n\\n## The Light at the End of the Tunnel\\nBut not all is lost. We don\u2019t have to feel this way forever, or accept that this is just how our lives will be. So I want to share some things that have helped me get through the hard times.\\n\\n### 1. Therapy, Therapy, and More Therapy\\nNever underestimate the power of speaking to a professional. Therapy helped me understand my patterns, where my feelings came from, and how to build healthier ways of coping. Most importantly, I learned my worth isn\u2019t tied to my job title or achievements.\\n\\nI found that talking to someone who can guide you through your journey\u2014who helps you understand how you got to this place\u2014can completely change the game. But I\u2019ll be honest: it isn\u2019t easy, like people sometimes make it sound online. Facing memories and realities in your own little (but huge) world takes real courage. Still, as someone who\u2019s been there, I promise you can take a step forward and learn to deal with these feelings so they don\u2019t stop your life.\\n\\nI know talking about mental health is \u201ccool\u201d on the internet, but in real life I\u2019ve had to deal with people saying things like, \u201cWhy do you need that? You were raised in church, just pray and it\u2019ll go away,\u201d or \u201cAre you going crazy? Is that why you need a doctor?\u201d or \u201cIf you just ignore it, it goes away.\u201d Unfortunately, a lot of people still think like that. But here\u2019s my advice, friend to friend: ignore those voices. Focus on caring for yourself and asking for help. It changed my life\u2014it can change yours too.\\n\\n### 2. Take Medication If You Need It\\nThere\u2019s no shame in seeking medical help if you need it. Sometimes our minds need the same care we\u2019d give to a broken bone or any other illness. Medication\u2014when prescribed by a professional\u2014can be a crucial part of healing, and that\u2019s okay.\\n\\nI know taking medication can be scary; trust me, I felt that fear and dealt with all the stigma that comes with it\u2014especially around medication for depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and so on. Not everyone needs it, but in my case, it was necessary. When I started, my life changed. Before that, I couldn\u2019t study, eat, or even take care of my basic hygiene because of all the anxiety and sadness I felt. I\u2019d only shower to go to work, then come home and sleep until the next day. It was a really hard period, and I made it through with medical help.\\n\\nBut I also have to say\u2014taking medication alone isn\u2019t enough. If you don\u2019t also address the root cause in therapy, you won\u2019t really get better. Medication can help stabilize things, but therapy helps you heal. So if you need it, take your medication with professional guidance\u2014and don\u2019t give up on the process.\\n\\n### 3. Share How You\u2019re Feeling With People You Trust\\nOpen up to friends, family, or even colleagues you feel safe with. You\u2019d be surprised how many people have similar feelings but are just afraid to speak up. You are not alone, and letting others in can make a world of difference.\\n\\nSupport from people you trust is crucial in those dark times\u2014it really does change everything. A few years ago, when I tried to end my life, what stopped me after the third attempt was finally asking for help. That help turned everything around, and I\u2019m here today because of it.\\n\\n### 4. Start Small\u2014One Thing at a Time\\nYou don\u2019t need to change your whole life overnight. Celebrate small wins\u2014learning a new thing, finishing a task, or even just taking a break when you need it. Progress is progress, no matter the size.\\n\\nThis was honestly the hardest thing for me to understand and put into practice. Starting simple and completing small tasks to build real progress\u2014but once I began, I started seeing results and learning more effectively. I realized there\u2019s no point trying to learn everything at once. Focus on something, but don\u2019t forget to live and rest. Learning is important, but if you push too hard and burn out, it\u2019s not worth it.\\n\\n## Remember: You Are Enough\\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to know every new technology or be everyone\u2019s role model. All you need is to care for yourself and move forward at your own pace.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re struggling right now, please remember: you\u2019re not alone, and things can get better. The tech world can be hard, but it can also be full of kindness and support\u2014sometimes, you just have to ask for it.\\n\\nLet\u2019s talk more openly about mental health. We all have our own battles, but together, we can make the journey lighter.\\n\\nAnd if you ever want to share your story\u2014or just need someone to listen\u2014my inbox is always open. \ud83d\udc99"},{"id":"python-tips-fun-facts","metadata":{"permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/python-tips-fun-facts","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-06-24-python-tips.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-24-python-tips.md","title":"Fun Python Tips & Curious Facts Every Developer Should Know","description":"Some Python tips and fun facts to make your coding journey more interesting!","date":"2025-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"python","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/tags/python"},{"inline":true,"label":"software development","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/tags/software-development"},{"inline":true,"label":"career","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/tags/career"},{"inline":true,"label":"tips","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/tags/tips"}],"readingTime":4.255,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Carol Soares","title":"Backend Enginner @ Thoughtworks","url":"https://github.com/carolinesoarws","page":{"permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/authors/carolsoares"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-soares-0ba238107/","github":"https://github.com/carolinesoarws"},"imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83501330?v=4","key":"carolsoares"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"python-tips-fun-facts","title":"Fun Python Tips & Curious Facts Every Developer Should Know","authors":"carolsoares","tags":["python","software development","career","tips"],"description":"Some Python tips and fun facts to make your coding journey more interesting!"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Dealing with mental helth as a Developer","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/mental-helth-being-a-developer"},"nextItem":{"title":"What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/large-language-models-llm"}},"content":"Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc0d\u2728 <br/>\\n\\nPython isn\u2019t just a programming language \u2014 it\u2019s a whole vibe. Whether you\u2019re just starting out, or already writing scripts before your morning tea (yep, I know \u2014 sorry, developer community, I don\u2019t drink coffee!), there\u2019s always something new (or quirky!) to learn. So here are some fun Python facts and tips to brighten your dev day:\\n\\n---\\n\\n## The Zen of Python\\n\\nDid you know Python comes with its own \u201cphilosophy poem\u201d?\\nJust open your terminal and type:\\n\\n```python\\nimport this\\n```\\n\\nYou\u2019ll get the **Zen of Python**\u201419 guiding aphorisms by Tim Peters, like:\\n\\n* \u201cBeautiful is better than ugly.\u201d\\n* \u201cSimple is better than complex.\u201d\\n* \u201cReadability counts.\u201d\\n\\nTrust me, if you haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s worth a look. It\u2019s like a fortune cookie for developers. \ud83d\udc0d\\n\\n\\n## Naming Your Python Files: camelCase or snake\\\\_case?\\n\\nSpoiler alert: In Python, the **PEP8 style guide** recommends using `snake_case` (lowercase with underscores) for filenames and function names\u2014like `my_awesome_script.py`.\\n\\nBut\u2026 what happens if you use camelCase, like `myAwesomeScript.py`?\\n\\nTechnically, your script will still work, and you can even import it using the same name. But if you ever share your code, or move between Windows and Linux, you might run into confusing import errors (since Linux treats uppercase and lowercase as different files). Plus, Python tools and most developers expect `snake_case` for file and module names\u2014so using camelCase can lead to warnings, headaches, and harder-to-maintain code.\\n\\nSave yourself (and your team) some future trouble\u2014stick to `snake_case` for filenames and module names. Your future self will thank you! \ud83d\ude09\\n\\n\\n\\n## Why is it Called Python?\\n\\nNo, it\u2019s not named after the snake!\\nGuido van Rossum, Python\u2019s creator, named it after the British comedy group \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.\u201d\\nSo, it\u2019s not uncommon to see official docs and tutorials full of jokes and silly references.\\nNext time you see a variable called `spam` or `eggs`\u2014now you know why!\\n\\n\\n## Bonus Tips to Power Up Your Python\\n\\n#### **F-strings make formatting a breeze:**\\nInstead of `\\"Hello, {}\\".format(name)` use `f\\"Hello, {name}\\"`.\\n\\n\\n#### **List comprehensions save time:**\\n  `[x*x for x in range(10)]`\\n  One line, super readable.\\n\\n#### **Want to see all built-in functions?**\\n  Try `dir(__builtins__)` in the REPL.\\n\\n#### **Use virtual environments:**\\n  Run `python -m venv venv` to keep your project dependencies isolated (and your global Python happy).\\n\\n#### **Multiple variable assignment:**\\n  You can assign several variables at once:\\n  `a, b, c = 1, 2, 3` <br/><br/>\\n  Clean and \u201cpythonic\u201d!\u2728\\n\\n#### **Swap variables in one line:**\\n  No need for a temporary variable:\\n  `a, b = b, a`\\n\\n#### **The \u201celse\u201d in loops:**\\n  You can use `else` with a `for` or `while` loop! The `else` block runs only if the loop wasn\u2019t interrupted by a `break`.\\n\\n  ```python\\n  for n in range(5):\\n      if n == 3:\\n          print(\\"Found 3!\\")\\n          break\\n  else:\\n      print(\\"3 not found!\\")\\n  ```\\n\\n#### **Underscore (`_`) for ignoring values:**\\n  Don\u2019t care about a value in an assignment or loop? Use `_` as a placeholder: <br/>\\n  `for _, value in enumerate(my_list):`\\n\\n#### **Get the index and value in a loop:**\\n  Use `enumerate()` for easy indexing:\\n\\n  ```python\\n  for index, value in enumerate([\'a\', \'b\', \'c\']):\\n      print(index, value)\\n  ```\\n\\n#### **Use `join()` to concatenate strings in a list:**\\n\\n  ```python\\n  words = [\\"Hello\\", \\"world\\"]\\n  sentence = \\" \\".join(words)  # Output: \\"Hello world\\"\\n  ```\\n\\n#### **Quickly reverse a list:**\\n\\n  ```python\\n  my_list[::-1]\\n  ```\\n\\n\\n## Docs, PEPs & the Awesome Python Community\\n\\n* **Official Docs Are Your Best Friend:**\\n  The [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is clear, detailed, and full of examples. Whenever you\u2019re unsure about a function, module, or syntax, check the docs first\u2014it will save you hours of guessing and Stack Overflow deep dives.\\n\\n* **PEPs: Python Enhancement Proposals:**\\n  Ever wondered how Python evolves? Through PEPs! These documents describe new features, improvements, and the philosophy of Python. The most famous one is [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), which defines Python\u2019s style guide.\\n  Some other fun PEPs to check out:\\n\\n  * [PEP 20 \u2013 The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)\\n  * [PEP 257 \u2013 Docstring Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)\\n  * [PEP 484 \u2013 Type Hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/)\\n\\n* **Write Great Docstrings:**\\n  Good code tells a story\u2014so help your future self (and your teammates) by writing clear docstrings for your functions, classes, and modules!\\n  Use triple quotes and follow [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/):\\n\\n  ```python\\n  def add(a, b):\\n      \\"\\"\\"\\n      Add two numbers and return the result.\\n\\n      Args:\\n          a (int): First number.\\n          b (int): Second number.\\n\\n      Returns:\\n          int: The sum of a and b.\\n      \\"\\"\\"\\n      return a + b\\n  ```\\n\\n* **Python Community is Everywhere:**\\n  Don\u2019t code alone!\\n\\n  * Join [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/)\\n  * Follow the [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) subreddit\\n  * Attend local meetups or PyCon events\\n  * Or ask questions on Stack Overflow\u2014Python\u2019s community is famously friendly and helpful!\\n\\n* **Contribute Back!**\\n  Python thrives on open source and community contributions. Whether you\u2019re fixing a typo in the docs, adding a tutorial, or helping someone on a forum, you\u2019re already making Python better for everyone.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### \ud83e\udde0 One Last Curiosity\u2026\\n\\nThe Zen of Python ends with:\\n\\n> \u201cAlthough practicality beats purity.\u201d\\n> So if you ever feel lost in style rules, remember: It\u2019s better to write code that works (and that you understand), than to get stuck trying to be perfect."},{"id":"large-language-models-llm","metadata":{"permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/large-language-models-llm","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-05-31-about-llm.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-31-about-llm.md","title":"What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?","description":"A simple yet technical guide to understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they\u2019re reshaping the way we build products.","date":"2025-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"llm","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/tags/llm"},{"inline":true,"label":"generative ai","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/tags/generative-ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"product-development","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/tags/product-development"}],"readingTime":5.1,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Carol Soares","title":"Backend Enginner @ Thoughtworks","url":"https://github.com/carolinesoarws","page":{"permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/authors/carolsoares"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-soares-0ba238107/","github":"https://github.com/carolinesoarws"},"imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83501330?v=4","key":"carolsoares"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"large-language-models-llm","title":"What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?","authors":"carolsoares","tags":["ai","llm","generative ai","product-development"],"description":"A simple yet technical guide to understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they\u2019re reshaping the way we build products."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Fun Python Tips & Curious Facts Every Developer Should Know","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/python-tips-fun-facts"},"nextItem":{"title":"My Experience at TheDevConf 2025","permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/dtc-conference"}},"content":"Hey everyone! \ud83d\udcbb\u2728 <br />\\n\\nToday I want to talk about something I\u2019ve been working: **Large Language Models** (LLMs). If you\'ve been hearing a lot about ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, or LLaMA and wondered *what all the buzz is about* \u2014 I\u2019ve got you. Let\u2019s break it down in a clear and friendly way.\\n\\n\\n## What Exactly Is a Large Language Model?\\n\\nA **Large Language Model** is a type of **artificial intelligence** designed to understand and generate human language. Think of it as a super smart assistant that\u2019s read massive amounts of data \u2014 books, articles, code, forum posts, and even images or videos \u2014 and now knows how to generate coherent and useful text responses. \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nThey\'re called *\\"large\\"* because they contain billions (and sometimes trillions!) of parameters \u2014 which are essentially learned settings that help the model detect patterns in language.\\n\\n\\n## How Are LLMs Created?\\n\\nEverything starts with **training** \u2014 and here\u2019s where things get a little technical, but in a good way.\\n\\nAt the core of most LLMs is a deep learning architecture called the **Transformer**, introduced by Google in 2017. (For the curious minds, here\u2019s the original [\u201cAttention Is All You Need\u201d](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper.) This architecture revolutionized the way we work with language in AI by making it possible to model relationships between words over long distances in a text.\\n\\nRather than analyzing words one at a time, Transformers allow the model to understand entire sequences at once \u2014 similar to how *you* read a message and instantly understands its meaning, even without emojis or GIFs. \ud83d\udcac\\n\\n### Tools That Power LLM Development\\n\\nMost LLMs are developed using **Python**, alongside popular deep learning libraries like:\\n\\n* **PyTorch** \u2013 widely used in research and production\\n* **TensorFlow** \u2013 known for its scalability and performance\\n* **JAX** \u2013 favored by Google for high-performance model training\\n\\nThese frameworks help build the model\u2019s internal architecture, which includes:\\n\\n* **Embedding layers** \u2013 turn words into vector representations the model can process\\n* **Multi-head self-attention** \u2013 lets the model \\"pay attention\\" to all words in a sentence at once\\n* **Feed-forward neural networks** \u2013 deepen the understanding of context\\n* **Layer normalization and residual connections** \u2013 stabilize the learning process\\n\\nThese components are stacked dozens of times (up to 96 layers in models like GPT-4), resulting in deep networks with *massive* capacity for language understanding.\\n\\n\\n## How Do LLMs Actually Learn?\\n\\nLLMs are trained using **self-supervised learning**, which means they learn by predicting words in vast amounts of unlabeled text.\\n\\nThere are two common objectives:\\n\\n* **Causal Language Modeling (CLM)** \u2013 Predict the *next* word in a sentence (e.g., GPT)\\n* **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** \u2013 Predict *missing* words in a sentence (e.g., BERT)\\n\\nTo learn, the model uses:\\n\\n* **Backpropagation** \u2013 a mathematical technique for adjusting internal parameters based on mistakes\\n* **Gradient descent** \u2013 an optimization method that helps the model improve gradually with each example\\n\\nWith time and repetition, the model becomes excellent at predicting what comes next in a sentence \u2014 which is exactly what allows it to write stories, generate code, answer questions, and so much more.\\n\\n\\n## Training at Scale: A Super Brain Goes To the Gym \\n\\nTraining an LLM is like sending a super-brain to bootcamp \u2014 lifting data instead of weights \u2014 for *weeks* or even *months*.\\n\\nIt requires:\\n\\n* **Hardware**: Hundreds to thousands of GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A100s) or TPUs\\n* **Data**: Terabytes of curated text \u2014 books, articles, forums, code repositories, etc.\\n* **Optimization techniques**:\\n\\n  * **Mixed precision training** (for memory efficiency)\\n  * **Gradient checkpointing** (to reduce memory usage)\\n  * **Data/model parallelism** (to spread the workload across multiple devices)\\n\\n\\n## What Happens After Training?\\n\\nOnce the model is trained, it can be:\\n\\n* **Fine-tuned** for specific domains (e.g., healthcare, law, customer support)\\n* **Aligned** with human values using **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** \u2014 the secret sauce behind ChatGPT\u2019s natural tone\\n\\n\\n## Where Are LLMs Being Used?\\n\\nEverywhere! Some real-world applications include:\\n\\n* **Chatbots** and **virtual assistants** (like ChatGPT, Bard, Copilot)\\n* **Internal knowledge bases** and **customer support tools**\\n* **Coding assistants** (GitHub Copilot, Cody, etc.)\\n* **Business intelligence** (summarizing reports, extracting insights)\\n* **Education** (tutoring, quiz generation)\\n* **Marketing & eCommerce** (product descriptions, reviews, emails)\\n\\n\\n## How Developers Use LLMs Every Day\\n\\nLLMs are easier to integrate than ever \u2014 here\u2019s how devs can use them right now:\\n\\n### 1. **OpenAI GPT (ChatGPT)**\\n\\nUse the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs) to add `gpt-4` or `gpt-3.5-turbo` to your apps.\\n\\nUse cases:\\nChatbots, AI helpdesks, content generation, code explanation, test generation.\\n\\n\\n### 2. **Google PaLM 2 / Gemini**\\n\\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/overview) supports powerful LLMs for enterprise apps.\\n\\nUse cases:\\nMultimodal apps, enterprise search, document analysis.\\n\\n\\n### 3. **Anthropic Claude**\\n\\n[Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude) is known for its thoughtful responses and safe design.

In recognition of my contributions, my company awarded me the opportunity to attend TDC \u2014 The Developer Conference AI, that happen in S\xe3o Paulo, Brazil.\\n\\nThis conference is aimed at developers connecting with each other, discovering new trends, discussing best practices, sharing knowledge, etc. It was my first time attending a conference, and honestly, I felt like Sheldon! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n![Sheldon Cooper, a famous character from the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory, wearing a red t-shirt, holding chopsticks and a plate, turning his head, and smiling with his mouth closed.](../static/img/sheldon.gif)\\n</p>\\n\\n\\nI\u2019m someone who, on the surface, seems sociable, but I hate being in large crowds and never really got excited about these types of events. I always thought they were overrated. I don\u2019t even believe in astrology, but I\u2019ll blame it on my sign today hahahaha.\\n\\nThe conference took place on March 26th and 27th, 2025, and it focused on artificial intelligence. There were several panels covering various topics related to generative AI. In general, the panels discussed how AI is being applied in different areas like healthcare, agriculture, software development, everyday life, and more. And I\u2019d love to share some of the themes that impacted me the most.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n![a hand holding tdc name tag card](../static/img/IMG_7760.jpeg)\\n</p>\\n\\nThe first panel that really struck me was from a company that uses AI to monitor neonatal ICUs. Through the electrodes placed on the babies, data is collected and analyzed in real time by a system using generative AI. The case presented involved a newborn with complications. When the baby started having significant changes that required medical intervention, the system had already identified the issue *hours in advance* \u2014 the baby was having an epileptic seizure. With this analysis, doctors were able to act quickly, and the baby survived. In fact, the baby is now healthy and growing well, under medical supervision of course. Incredible, right? I was deeply moved by this case!\\n\\nThe second impactful panel was about the use of generative AI in agriculture. They showed how AI is transforming the industry through soil, weather, and livestock analysis... The presenter even showed AI-powered cameras being used for these analyses, for example. One thing I was curious about was the stereotype that people in agriculture are resistant to technology. The speaker explained that the new generation in agribusiness is much more open to using technology in their daily work, and even many from older generations understand its importance now. It was really cool!!\\n\\nThe third panel that impressed me was a presentation by a team working on modernizing legacy code. With the help of generative AI, a parte of the code that was expected to take a year to be complete, actually took 6 months. Amazing, right? That\u2019s a huge time savings!\\n\\nWhat I enjoyed most about the talks I participated, was that the speakers emphasized the importance of using AI consciously and responsibly. And this goes way beyond just using AI for anything\u2014it\u2019s about knowing why you\u2019re using it, applying prompt engineering to get accurate responses, validating whether the AI\'s response is correct, checking if it\u2019s \\"hallucinating,\\" and so on. Not to mention the environmental impact of AI usage, which is a real can of worms\u2014girl, it\u2019s scary!\\n\\nThis conference was amazing! I had so much fun, learned a lot, and met some incredible professionals! For example, I participated in a mentorship focused on working on international projects, which is exactly the direction I want my career to go right now. I absolutely loved it and I think the experience is totally worth it!\\n\\nNegative points:\\n - The location wasn\u2019t great, and there weren\u2019t any nearby restaurants to have lunch without a long walk\u2014which I didn\u2019t love.\\n - The food experience was poor. The event had announced that there would be partner food vendors, but in the end, there weren\u2019t any. There was a communication failure, which was a big deal since I spent the whole day there. Especially because I was alone and didn\u2019t feel safe walking around that part of S\xe3o Paulo on my own.\\n\\nPositive points:\\n - The venue itself was really nice.\\n - I got a bunch of free goodies, which was super fun!\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n![ecobag that i got in the conference, the ecobag is white](../static/img/IMG_7758.jpeg)\\n</p>\\n\\n - The \\"silent presentation\\" format was the coolest part: basically, three panels were happening at the same time. We wore headphones and could switch stations at any time to follow whichever presentation we wanted.\\n - I really enjoyed the networking, the spaces, the mentoring sessions, and the companies that were there!\\n\\nAll in all, it was absolutely worth it!"},{"id":"long-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/carol-soares-blog/blog/long-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-03-11-long-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-11-long-blog-post.md","title":"6 Months in an Innovation Lab","description":"Six months ago, I started working on an innovation project.

The main idea of this project is to test innovative solutions for problems using Generative AI. It\'s been a completely new world for me, as until then, I had only worked on product delivery. Working in this lab completely took me out of my bubble, especially because I am a backend engineer. During this period, I\'ve learned a few things:\\n\\n### Not Everything Can Be Solved with Generative AI\\nThe tech world is as crazy as the release of a new pop diva\'s album. The revolution of some emerging technologies makes many people in the market, especially business leaders, rush to implement these solutions at any cost. When a pop diva releases an iconic album, it\'s literally written in the stars that all brands, trends, and even the fashion industry will ride that wave. The same happens in technology: when truly impactful innovation arises, everyone wants to adopt, adapt, and capitalize on it. The problem is that, often, this rush happens without a real understanding of whether that tool is truly the right solution for the problem.\\n\\nWhat I love most about this project is that it forces me to think outside of my bubble and even question whether the solution I\u2019m proposing really makes sense for the business problem we\u2019re solving or if Generative AI meets our expectations. Not every problem needs Generative AI to be solved, but the fact that we reflect on the effectiveness of these technologies in our challenges completely changes the idea of \\"just using technology at any cost.\\"\\n\\n### Best Practices and Automation, Yes, Always!\\nIn this project, we deliver rapid prototypes. Therefore, we are constantly testing new solutions and making them available for evaluation. The fact that we deliver only prototypes **does not** mean that software best practices should be neglected. I\u2019ve felt firsthand how important it is to apply good development practices and have automated deployment in all projects.\\n\\nUsing new technology doesn\u2019t mean we need to abandon best practices or leave them only partially structured. They exist for a good reason: to make the developer\'s life easier and increase delivery speed. It has been very satisfying to see the greatness of these practices applied in my daily work, especially aligned with Generative AI, which means that a new technology *should not override* everything else. I love software best practices, and once you work by following this model, you don\'t want to do things any other way.\\n\\n### The Exponential Power of Generative AI\\nDuring this time, I had the chance to use some Generative AI models for our deliveries, and it\u2019s fascinating to see the exponential power of these technologies. One of the most striking models was OpenAI\u2019s embedding model, as well as the model for working with voice.\\n\\nAt one point, I had to work with RAG on a vector database, combined with an embedding model. It was **soo** cool to see the program\'s behavior when returning data based on search similarity, everything felt magical! But if there\u2019s no good database foundation, things can backfire. Also, some libraries can be heavy in Python, so if you don\u2019t have a machine that can handle it, you might end up with some headaches.\\n\\nIn my experience, I used chromadb as a vector database, and wow, that was a sentimental little database. Just one wrong configuration, and it doesn\'t work properly. At the time, I had to deploy it on AWS, and even though I configured communication ports for it to access the internet, it would pick any port except the one we wanted, and that was a pain! But for small tests, it behaved well, which makes me excited about the possibilities. I\u2019m currently exploring other vector databases, but it was really cool to learn from chromadb. I didn\u2019t know the concepts too deeply, but it was super interesting to work with.\\n\\nWhat saved me many times was the fact that I had a powerful machine to work with. I\u2019ve crashed my PC about 4 times in a row testing some extremely heavy models and libraries, but my machine survived. Even working with AWS Lambda or EC2, the process of using the libraries can be slow depending on the installation process, and Docker was our ally in that fight. One thing that makes me reflect on Gen AI is the fact that we need to have a decent machine to work with some libraries and models, at least locally. At least in my experience, after we included Docker, it became much easier to work with these heavier libraries like langchain, a dream on a summer night, literally.\\n\\nWith the voice model, it was very interesting to notice the naturalness in the speech, especially with some accents, which really surprised me!! The model we tested for conversation flow had such a great tone that can be calibrated, which opens infinite possibilities for accessibility, and that\'s amazing!\\n\\nGenerative AI, when aligned correctly, is amazing and takes delivery standards to the next level! I\u2019ve learned to be flexible in this regard, the ability to test different models, aligned with best practices, is out of this world.\\n\\n### Women in Power!\\nIn this project, many amazing, intelligent, and supportive people have passed through. But I\u2019m very proud to say that the team is mostly female. What a joy it is to work with other women, share experiences\u2026 I feel heard, welcomed, and embraced. A privilege!\\n\\nThese past few months have been great."}]}}')}}]);
