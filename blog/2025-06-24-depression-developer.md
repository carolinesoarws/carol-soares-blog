Hey everyone! ❤️✨ <br />

Being a developer means dealing with a lot—balancing life, managing clients, keeping up with the fast evolution of IT, surviving in a hyper-competitive world, and racing to build your career. It’s a lot to handle, and today, I want to talk about what’s usually left unsaid.

## The Hidden Depression
I started my career at 20. Looking back, I was really young when I first entered the corporate world and realized how tough it can be. I struggled a lot to find my place as a developer—and being a woman added a whole other layer of challenge (but that’s a topic for another post). I pushed myself to learn what I could, to be better every single day, until I hit burnout at 23.

During that period, I didn’t know how to take care of myself. I kept comparing my journey and skills to others, constantly feeling like I wasn’t good enough. I would cry every day in the bathroom at work if I made a mistake or didn’t meet expectations. The worst part? The pressure was all coming from inside—I just didn’t know how to deal with it.

It got even worse. I watched people around me get promoted or recognized, while I felt invisible. “What’s wrong with me? Why am I not like them?” I asked myself over and over. I kept chasing improvement, but no matter how much I tried, I felt like I’d never be that standout developer—the one who’s different, better, the reference for others. Three years into my career, that’s how I felt.

Honestly, sometimes I still do. Every time I open LinkedIn, attend a conference, or talk to other developers, I question if I’m enough. When the industry starts hyping a new technology, I panic: “How am I supposed to learn everything, fast? How will I meet expectations? Where do I even start?”

If I don’t have experience with a certain technology—one I never even had the chance to work with—I feel like I’m failing at “being that amazing, senior, all-knowing developer who’s a role model no matter the company.”

Even after years of therapy, these feelings still pop up. It’s tough to deal with them every single day. That’s the hidden depression for me. Everyone tries to look perfect (and maybe they are), while I feel like I’ll never measure up. Tech is an amazing, exciting world, but it can also be lonely, overwhelming, and sometimes, deeply painful.

## The Light at the End of the Tunnel
But not all is lost. We don’t have to feel this way forever, or accept that this is just how our lives will be. So I want to share some things that have helped me get through the hard times.

### 1. Therapy, Therapy, and More Therapy
Never underestimate the power of speaking to a professional. Therapy helped me understand my patterns, where my feelings came from, and how to build healthier ways of coping. Most importantly, I learned my worth isn’t tied to my job title or achievements.

I found that talking to someone who can guide you through your journey—who helps you understand how you got to this place—can completely change the game. But I’ll be honest: it isn’t easy, like people sometimes make it sound online. Facing memories and realities in your own little (but huge) world takes real courage. Still, as someone who’s been there, I promise you can take a step forward and learn to deal with these feelings so they don’t stop your life.

I know talking about mental health is “cool” on the internet, but in real life I’ve had to deal with people saying things like, “Why do you need that? You were raised in church, just pray and it’ll go away,” or “Are you going crazy? Is that why you need a doctor?” or “If you just ignore it, it goes away.” Unfortunately, a lot of people still think like that. But here’s my advice, friend to friend: ignore those voices. Focus on caring for yourself and asking for help. It changed my life—it can change yours too.

### 2. Take Medication If You Need It
There’s no shame in seeking medical help if you need it. Sometimes our minds need the same care we’d give to a broken bone or any other illness. Medication—when prescribed by a professional—can be a crucial part of healing, and that’s okay.

I know taking medication can be scary; trust me, I felt that fear and dealt with all the stigma that comes with it—especially around medication for depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and so on. Not everyone needs it, but in my case, it was necessary. When I started, my life changed. Before that, I couldn’t study, eat, or even take care of my basic hygiene because of all the anxiety and sadness I felt. I’d only shower to go to work, then come home and sleep until the next day. It was a really hard period, and I made it through with medical help.

But I also have to say—taking medication alone isn’t enough. If you don’t also address the root cause in therapy, you won’t really get better. Medication can help stabilize things, but therapy helps you heal. So if you need it, take your medication with professional guidance—and don’t give up on the process.

### 3. Share How You’re Feeling With People You Trust
Open up to friends, family, or even colleagues you feel safe with. You’d be surprised how many people have similar feelings but are just afraid to speak up. You are not alone, and letting others in can make a world of difference.

Support from people you trust is crucial in those dark times—it really does change everything. A few years ago, when I tried to end my life, what stopped me after the third attempt was finally asking for help. That help turned everything around, and I’m here today because of it.

### 4. Start Small—One Thing at a Time
You don’t need to change your whole life overnight. Celebrate small wins—learning a new thing, finishing a task, or even just taking a break when you need it. Progress is progress, no matter the size.

This was honestly the hardest thing for me to understand and put into practice. Starting simple and completing small tasks to build real progress—but once I began, I started seeing results and learning more effectively. I realized there’s no point trying to learn everything at once. Focus on something, but don’t forget to live and rest. Learning is important, but if you push too hard and burn out, it’s not worth it.

## Remember: You Are Enough
You don’t have to be perfect. You don’t have to know every new technology or be everyone’s role model. All you need is to care for yourself and move forward at your own pace.

If you’re struggling right now, please remember: you’re not alone, and things can get better. The tech world can be hard, but it can also be full of kindness and support—sometimes, you just have to ask for it.

Let’s talk more openly about mental health. We all have our own battles, but together, we can make the journey lighter.
